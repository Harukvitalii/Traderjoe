Project Description - Software for Automatization of DEX TraderJoe Pool

The software aims to enable the automatization of the DEX TraderJoe pool trading process. The overall goal of the software is to help investors maximize their gains while minimizing losses by automatically trading on the cryptocurrency market.

The software will be designed to track the price movements of cryptocurrencies within the TraderJoe marketplace and react accordingly. When the price of a particular token falls outside of a user-defined range, the software will initiate action to prevent further losses. This may include selling or buying tokens on the market depending on the conditions set.

Overall, the software will provide an efficient and effective solution to traders seeking to automate the DEX TraderJoe pool trading process. By simplifying the entire process, investors can minimize errors due to emotional trading decisions and focus on maximizing returns.
